Description
=

    How far can you make a stack of cards overhang a table? If you have one
    card, you can create a maximum overhang of half a card length. (We're
    assuming that the cards must be perpendicular to the table.) With two cards
    you can make the top card overhang the bottom one by half a card length,
    and the bottom one overhang the table by a third of a card length, for a
    total maximum overhang of 1/2 + 1/3 = 5/6 card lengths. In general you can
    make n cards overhang by 1/2 + 1/3 + 1/4 + ... + 1/(n + 1) card lengths,
    where the top card overhangs the second by 1/2, the second overhangs tha
    third by 1/3, the third overhangs the fourth by 1/4, etc., and the bottom
    card overhangs the table by 1/(n + 1). This is illustrated in the figure
    below.


Input
=

    The input consists of one or more test cases, followed by a line containing
    the number 0.00 that signals the end of the input. Each test case is a
    single line containing a positive floating-point number c whose value is at
    least 0.01 and at most 5.20; c will contain exactly three digits.

Output
=

    For each test case, output the minimum number of cards necessary to achieve
    an overhang of at least c card lengths. Use the exact output format shown
    in the examples.
