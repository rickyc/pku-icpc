Description
=
    Some people believe that there are three cycles in a person's life that
    start the day he or she is born. These three cycles are the physical,
    emotional, and intellectual cycles, and they have periods of lengths 23,
    28, and 33 days, respectively. There is one peak in each period of a cycle.
    At the peak of a cycle, a person performs at his or her best in the
    corresponding field (physical, emotional or mental). For example, if it is
    the mental curve, thought processes will be sharper and concentration will
    be easier.  Since the three cycles have different periods, the peaks of the
    three cycles generally occur at different times. We would like to determine
    when a triple peak occurs (the peaks of all three cycles occur in the same
    day) for any person. For each cycle, you will be given the number of days
    from the beginning of the current year at which one of its peaks (not
    necessarily the first) occurs. You will also be given a date expressed as
    the number of days from the beginning of the current year. You task is to
    determine the number of days from the given date to the next triple peak.
    The given date is not counted. For example, if the given date is 10 and the
    next triple peak occurs on day 12, the answer is 2, not 3. If a triple peak
    occurs on the given date, you should give the number of days to the next
    occurrence of a triple peak.

Input
=

    You will be given a number of cases. The input for each case consists of
    one line of four integers p, e, i, and d. The values p, e, and i are the
    number of days from the beginning of the current year at which the
    physical, emotional, and intellectual cycles peak, respectively. The value
    d is the given date and may be smaller than any of p, e, or i. All values
    are non-negative and at most 365, and you may assume that a triple peak
    will occur within 21252 days of the given date. The end of input is
    indicated by a line in which p = e = i = d = -1.

Output
=

    For each test case, print the case number followed by a message indicating
    the number of days to the next triple peak, in the form:

    Case 1: the next triple peak occurs in 1234 days.

    Use the plural form ``days'' even if the answer is 1.

    Case 5: the next triple peak occurs in 8910 days.
    Case 6: the next triple peak occurs in 10789 days.
